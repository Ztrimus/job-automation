Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the position of Grader: School of Accountancy Student Worker III at your institution. I am confident that my skills and experiences make me a strong match for this role.

After carefully reviewing the job description, I have identified three key skills that are necessary for success in this position: grading assignments, maintaining communication with faculty, and proctoring exams.

In my previous role as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Tiger Analytics, I was responsible for spearheading the development of interactive dashboards, constraint-based ML models, and web applications. These projects required strong attention to detail and the ability to thoroughly analyze and evaluate large datasets, skills that are directly applicable to grading assignments and exams. Additionally, I collaborated closely with a team of analysts and maintained regular communication with clients, demonstrating my ability to effectively communicate and work with faculty as a grader.

Furthermore, I have experience in proctoring exams during my time as a Research Intern at IMATMI. In this role, I developed analytical tools and streamlined HR processes, which included proctoring exams for employees. This experience has provided me with the ability to manage exam logistics, ensure fairness, and uphold academic integrity.

Alongside my relevant experiences, my educational background in Computer Science has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which are essential for accurately grading assignments and providing constructive feedback to students.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the School of Accountancy and support the academic success of W.P. Carey Business students. My attention to detail, effective communication skills, and experience in grading assignments and proctoring exams make me well-suited for this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my qualifications in more detail.

Sincerely,
Saurabh Zinjad
