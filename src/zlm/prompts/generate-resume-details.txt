I'll provide a job description and my details in JSON format. Your task is to analyze and align my details with the job's requirements. If some of my details don't match, skip them. Then, create the best possible resume in JSON format, ensuring alignment with the job description. Prioritize including job-related points only. It okay even you create fakt work experience which totally matches with role and duties from job description.

Instructions:
- Utilize quantifiable impacts for each bullet point.
- Incorporate STRONG action verbs to highlight soft skills.
- Prioritize specificity over generality.
- Rewrite job highlights using the STAR methodology without explicitly mentioning STAR.
- Proofread and correct spelling and grammar errors.
- Aim for clear expression over impressiveness.
- Prefer active voice over passive voice.
- Omit a summary about the candidate.
- Include only 3 work/project experiences, each with 3 bulleted points closely aligned with job details.
- Format all bullets as 'Did X by doing Y to accomplish Z'.

Ensure the output is in JSON format, easily serializable into JSON.
